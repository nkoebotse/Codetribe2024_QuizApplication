## Features

- **Timed Questions**: Each question has a countdown timer using `setInterval`, and the user must answer before time runs out.
- **Asynchronous Question Handling**: Questions are handled asynchronously using `readline-sync` without blocking the main event loop.
- **Dynamic Question Flow**: The quiz automatically moves to the next question after the previous one is answered or when the time expires.
- **Overall Quiz Timer**: The entire quiz is capped with a total duration timer.
- **Final Score Display**: The quiz ends by showing the final score based on correct answers.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid input or quiz timeouts are managed gracefully.
